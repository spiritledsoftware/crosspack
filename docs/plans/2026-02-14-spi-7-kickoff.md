# SPI-7 Kickoff Artifact

**Status:** started on `bezalel/spi-7-kickoff`

## Objective
Ship first SPI-7 increment to unblock SPI-8 dependency chain this cycle.

## Immediate Increment
1. Confirm SPI-7 acceptance criteria from Linear issue.
2. Implement smallest test-backed code change for SPI-7.
3. Run targeted + workspace validation.
4. Open/update SPI-7 PR and mark SPI-8 dependency state.

## Current Blocker
Linear issue access is unavailable in this runtime, so exact SPI-7 acceptance criteria cannot be pulled directly.

## Unblock Owner + Action
- **Owner:** Ian (access owner)
- **Action:** provide SPI-7/SPI-8 Linear IDs + acceptance criteria, or restore Linear CLI/token integration.

## Hard ETA (conditional)
- First SPI-7 code PR update: within 20 minutes of receiving scope.
- SPI-8 dependency update in Linear: within 10 minutes after SPI-7 PR update is posted.
